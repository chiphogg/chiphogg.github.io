Animated visualizations of Gaussian Process priors

<p>How can we visualize a probability distribution of functions?</p>
<p>One way is <em>animations</em>. Each frame shows a single function: a single sample from the distribution. Consecutive frames are <em>correlated</em>, so that the function appears to move. The vertical motion indicates the magnitude of the uncertainty at a point. The horizontal structure shows how different points are related to each other for functions in the distribution.</p>
<p>Not all animation techniques are equally effective. This page compares different techniques: beginning with the pre-existing approaches, and working towards a new method which combines the best features of all.</p>
<p>(Every figure visualizes the same distribution: a Squared Exponential covariance, with hyperparameters <span class="math inline">\(\left(\ell = 1, \sigma = 1\right)\)</span>.)</p>
<h2 id="interpolation">Interpolation</h2>
<p>This method starts with a sequence of <em>independent</em> samples from the distribution. We then interpolate between neighboring samples, keeping the marginal distribution the same at all times.</p>
<p>(In other words: <em>any</em> individual frame -- even an interpolated one -- shows a sample from the distribution.)</p>
<div id="chart_interp">

</div>
<p>The main disadvantage is that the <em>keyframes</em> -- i.e., the frames with the original, independent samples -- are treated specially. Each keyframe exhibits a distracting &quot;jerk&quot; in the motion, as the function pivots to move towards the next keyframe.</p>
<h2 id="great-circles">Great Circles</h2>
<p><em>Great circles</em> are an alternative method which corrects the deficiencies of interpolation. Their motion is perfectly smooth. Moreover, every frame is exactly equivalent to every other frame.</p>
<p>This method works by producing a great circle in <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-dimensional space (where <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the number of points in the curve). Both the radius of the circle and its orientation are random.</p>
<div id="chart_hennig">

</div>
<p>This method exhibits more fluid and appealing motion, but it has a number of disadvantages.</p>
<p>First, it repeats itself, so that any given animation only visualizes a small fraction of the distribution. (By contrast, the interpolation method can continuously generate new curves, and explore more and more of the distribution over time.)</p>
<p>Second, circular paths are strongly <em>time-anticorrelated</em>. This means that whatever curve we see, we will soon see its &quot;opposite&quot;. (In the case of zero-mean priors, as on this page, this means we will see the exact negative -- watch it and see!)</p>
<h2 id="delocalized-oscillators">Delocalized oscillators</h2>
<p>This more flexible method contains the Great Circles method above as a special case. The motion is still perfectly smooth. However, it can be extended for longer time periods and take more complicated paths, visualizing much more of the distribution.</p>
<div id="chart_loop">

</div>
<p>The downside is that it still eventually repeats. Moreover, the resource requirements are <em>quadratic</em> in the length of the animation! This creates an unfortunate tension: we want longer animations (because they show more of the distribution), but the resource requirements quickly become unmanageable.</p>
<h2 id="compact-support-covariance-oscillators">Compact support covariance oscillators</h2>
<p>The method of <em>compact support covariance</em> combines the advantages of the above techniques, without the drawbacks. In this method, each frame is correlated only with other frames within a certain time window, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>. This correlation function is smooth everywhere; therefore, so is the motion. Furthermore, although no frames are treated specially in any way (as with great circles and delocalized oscillators), we can continue to generate new frames with constant resource requirements (as with interpolation).</p>
<div id="chart_CS">

</div>
<p>The resulting function does not journey from one discrete keyframe to the next, nor does it repeat its position indefinitely. Rather, it simply evolves. It takes a smooth, beautiful path through <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-dimensional space, exploring more and more of the distribution as time goes on. The viewer of this function can understand the distribution it represents simply by watching it move.</p>
<h2 id="other-distributions">Other distributions</h2>
<p>Of course, we could have visualized other distributions too. On this page, press <code>e</code> to see an Exponential distribution, and <code>m</code> to see a Matern (<span class="math inline">\(\nu = 3/2\)</span>). (You can also press <code>s</code> to go back to the original Squared Exponential distribution.)</p>
<p>Happy viewing!</p>
