<b>tl;dr:</b>
Perfectionism doesn't work.
</aside>
<article>
<p>I've been wanting to redo my website for a few years now.</p>
<p>I thought I could motivate myself by purchasing the domain name. Paying actual money -- surely that would get me moving! I learned otherwise when the one-year renewal bill came and I hadn't done a thing.</p>
<p>But now I <em>do</em> have a website (obviously). So what was stopping me before, and what changed?</p>
<h2 id="grand-plans">Grand plans</h2>
<p>The idea for the new site came at an exciting time in my life, when I had been voraciously reading about all kinds of new (to me) technologies.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">markdown</a> is lightweight, undistracting markup. Kind of like <a href="http://latex-project.org/intro.html">LaTeX</a>, but without looking like tag soup.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a> lets you stick snippets of R code inside a markdown document, and <em>automatically replace them with the results of <strong>running</strong> that code</em>.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">mathjax</a> finally -- <em>finally!</em> -- brings the power of <a href="http://latex-project.org/intro.html">LaTeX</a> equations to the modern web (i.e., <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a> instead of hideous rendered gifs).</li>
<li>
<a href="http://get.webgl.org/">WebGL</a> puts plugin-free interactive 3D environments right in the browser window.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a> offers mind-blowing<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> data visualization, with native <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics">vector graphics</a> to boot!</li>
<li>
<a href="http://acko.net/blog/making-mathbox/">mathbox.js</a> promises a full-featured, in-browser, 3D plotting library.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted it all: writing posts in lightweight R/markdown, and <em>automatically</em> getting beautiful, interactive, browser-native plots on the other end. It was hard to settle for anything less.</p>
<h2 id="building-rome-in-a-day">Building Rome in a day</h2>
<p>Looking back, it's no wonder I failed. My Grand Vision was a world apart from the <a href="http://nanoc.ws/assets/images/tutorial/default-site.png">default nanoc page</a> that greeted me on the (rare) occasions I tried working on my website. The chasm between them was stark, paralyzing, overpowering. I tried to get every detail straight in my mind from the beginning. It was like trying to build Rome in a day, or to eat a turkey dinner in a single bite.</p>
<p>Progress came only when I jettisoned most of my feature list, and concentrated on getting a small core working. This lets me practice and build familiarity; when I'm ready for more, I'll have a base to build on instead of starting from scratch.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Right now, of the list above, only <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">markdown</a> (using <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a>) and <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">mathjax</a> are working. I don't even have a good solution for images!<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> And that's fine with me: when I want them, I'll only have to figure out <em>one</em> thing, instead of <em>everything</em>.</p>
<h2 id="the-irony-of-perfectionism">The irony of perfectionism</h2>
<p>Many think of perfectionists as producing excellent work. That's wrong: perfectionists produce virtually <em>no</em> work. Perfectionism doesn't mean high standards; it means doing things out of order. It means wasting time on details when the foundation hasn't been laid. Ironically, this leaves less time for more important work, so perfectionism <em>actually harms the overall quality of work</em>.</p>
<p>It's a great relief to get the site as far along as it is. If I have a blog post idea, <em>I can just <strong>do</strong> it</em>, instead of filing it away in the "list of things to write about once I make my blog".</p>
<p>I still plan to do most or all of the things on my list. The difference is that by doing them one at a time, and being satisfied with imperfect solutions, I actually stand a chance to get them <em>done</em>.</p>

<li id="fn2"><p>By the way, I also didn't realize how much the <a href="http://nanoc.ws/assets/images/tutorial/default-site.png">default nanoc page</a> was holding me back. I spent too long tolerating its irrelevant sidebar while I tinkered with other pages. It wasn't until I finally blew it away that I realized how distracting it had been, and I was amazed how quickly I made progress once it was gone. If <em>you're</em> thinking of building a nanoc site, I recommend you gut the default sidebar right away.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
